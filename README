This is a set of simple scripts that give a graphical interface 
to the most used options of MTKBabel, an excellent command line program 
to manage i-Blue 747 GPS data loggers and other MTK based devices.

Installation
------------

You need to install the following dependencies:

* `Zenity <http://live.gnome.org/Zenity>`_; usually preinstalled with GNOME
* `MTKBabel <http://www.rigacci.org/wiki/doku.php/doc/appunti/hardware/gps_logger_i_blue_747>`_; available in most distributions.

Then run "make" and, as root, "make install".
Be sure to edit /etc/gmtkbabel.conf!
